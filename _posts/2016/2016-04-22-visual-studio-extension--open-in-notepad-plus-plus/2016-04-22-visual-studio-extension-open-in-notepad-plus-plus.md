The past weekend, I took a few moments to relish in the "fun" that is programming something that is not work-related. That creation came to be a Visual Studio extension, known as, "Open in Notepad++".

You might be wondering, what does this extension even do?

Well, it adds a new item to the context menu when right-clicking files/folders in the Solution Explorer:

The extension will attempt to find your installation of Notepad++, but if for some reason it cannot, you can always manually update the path in `Tools | Open in Notepad++`:

You can install this extension through the Extensions and Updates dialog inside of Visual Studio:

Or, grab the VSIX directly from the Visual Studio Gallery (also, go here to leave awesome reviews for me):
