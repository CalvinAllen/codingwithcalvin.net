Introducing "[Super Clean](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coding-with-calvin.super-clean)", an extension for Visual Studio 2022 and up that actually removes those pesky `bin` and `obj` folders!

You can trigger this amazing cleanup routine from the Solution Explorer - either by right-clicking on the solution node itself, or right-clicking on an individual project. Performing the action at the solution level will recursively delete all the necessary folders from all active projects in the solution. Conversely, triggering it from a single project will only clean that individual project.

Feel free to check it out, and let me know if you have any suggestions for it - I realize it could seem like its "done", but you never know what ideas folks might have!  PRs accepted, too, if you're into that sort of thing ðŸ˜‰.
