I'm excited to announce that I'm partnering with Apress to bring an IDE extensibility book to market! I've been working on this concept for a while, and I'm excited to finally be able to share it with you.

The tentative title is, "Getting Started with IDE Extensibility", and is slated to be published in August of 2024. That seems like a long time, but I want to give myself plenty of time to get it right, plus there are all kinds of other things going on in that timeframe, too.

The objective of the book is to give you a solid foundation in the concepts of IDE extensibility, and to help you get started building your own extensions. I'll be covering the basics how to build extensions for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and the plethora of JetBrains IDEs, using the same concept / project throughout the book in all three IDEs. Once the basic project chapters are complete, I'll go into some code reuse scenarios (to share across all of the IDEs - which require different programming languages), and a few more advanced scenarios of interesting possibilities.

I know extensibility can be kind of a niche topic, but it's something I'm extremely passionate about and I'm excited to get this project started!

Stay tuned for more information!
